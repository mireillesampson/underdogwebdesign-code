                <h2>The Lone Ranger of Newfoundland and Frankie the Furball</h2>

                  <p>When I was a kid in school, we were required to study computer science.
                  This was a subject we all loved and looked forward to excitedly: several times a week, we got to go to the
                  lab, fire up the computers and play video games.
                  The whole time. Every time. Yeah.</p>

                  <p>Why? My guess is that, like now, there must have
                  been a shortage of people who could actually teach real computer science class. So we got stuck with
                  playing pixelated versions of such board games as: Jeopardy and Wheel of Fortune...hello Vanna!
                  Seriously, it wasn’t even as advanced as the Super Mario Brothers my BFF would pester me to play
                  all night as she downed enough soda to induce juvenile diabetes.</p>


                  <p>It’s little wonder that I never saw myself as a techie kind of person; someone who could code or hook
                  up a printer - or even get the VCR to stop flashing 12:00.</p>

                  <p>So, how did a girl like me learn to code? Well, I decided to challenge my assumptions and guess what?
                  I won! It turns out that tech is much the same as any other skill: you find a good school, you learn it, you
                  practice it - and you get better and better. Funny, that.</p>

                  <p>Who is my stunningly beautiful, furry, Underdog mascot? That's Frankie. She likes food, long walks in the woods,
                  food, back scratches and <em>more food</em>.</p>

                          <h4>My Current Studies</h4>

                            <p>Having learned basic coding, I’m now working on User Experience (UX).</p>

                            <p>Remember how early tech was intensely
                            frustrating to use unless you were a seriously dedicated techie? Now, think of the Apple iPad. The single greatest
                            advantage that Apple had over its competitors was the understanding that tech needed to be user-friendly.
                            Apple didn’t invent the click-wheel they used to make the iPod; they didn’t invent the touch-screen, and the iPad was
                            not the first tablet computer ever made. Apple combined existing technologies
                            in designs that are easy and fun and incredibly useful. That’s why they are able to charge a premium over other
                            products - and why the company is worth an enormous great fortune.</p>

                            <p>Many organisations have come to understand the importance of researching and
                            designing a great user experience. Like HTML and CSS, I consider User Experience a solid foundational skill,
                            which is why I am doing these particular courses early on in my studies. UX is no longer a nice-to-have
                            skill, but is integral to building effective websites that will increase the probability potential customers or clients
                            will choose your organisation.</p>

              <h2>My Experience and Skills</h2>


              <h4>Research</h4>

              <p>I like digging. Not in the actual dirt...well, not anymore. I have taken courses on conducting
                research projects and worked for a biology professor, researching scientific literature. But, the most in-depth,
                roll-up-my-sleeves experience came when I volunteered for the Whale Research Centre (WRC) on a conservation study.
                The purpose of the randomised controlled study was to test an invention meant to reduce or eliminate the by-catch of porpoise in fishermen’s
                nets. This was intensive real-world product testing and it was my job to collect biological and oceanographic samples and usage data.</p>

              <p>This residential position had me down on the docks at 4am to meet the fishermen whose boats I would be working on.
                I spent long days out on the water, in all manner of weather and - when I wasn’t busy with my own work tasks -
                I joined the fishermen in picking and gutting fish. And I spent a lot of time not smelling very good. As in,
                seagulls would follow me around, apparently confused about which species I might be and whether I qualified
                as their food.</p>

              <p>I spent a lot of time on the boat of a man named Chubby. An old skipper who couldn’t have weighed more than 98lbs
                soaking wet, Chubby had been an overweight child and the name stuck around long after the weight had come off.
                A country music buff with a big sense of humour, Chubby was this village’s version of a drag queen. Whenever
                there was a fundraiser, he’d break out his guitar, his ladies wig and borrow a dress from his wife - and put on a
                show. It was less RuPaul, more like Agnes from Mrs Brown’s Boys. He even gave us volunteers a little private
                performance at a farewell BBQ.</p>


              <h4>Business</h4>

              <p>Growing up, other kids wanted to go to Disney World - I wanted my parents to move us. Anywhere. Preferably to
                the other end of the country. Why? Because it was somewhere different, where life would be different. It wasn’t
                that life was bad in my small coastal town, it was a great place for a kid to grow up: we had the beach, we had
                the woods, and we had a pizza shop with a juke box - what more could a kid want? I simply liked the idea of a
                different life for its own sake, but my parents never moved.</p>

              <p>As an adult, I have commitment issues...in the geographical sense. I’ve lived and worked in five countries on
                three continents, acquiring a business sense with an international flavour.</p>

              <p>Within six weeks of landing in Qatar I landed a job managing the start-up of a retail store within the Souq Waqif
                Arts Center. I’d managed a shop before and looked forward to being able to shape it from an empty room. The owner
                of the center wanted an arts supply store full of high-quality merchandise to cater to professional artists.
                He also wanted me to design the shop interior and the custom-made product displays - which I did in a style that respected
                the heritage of the old Souq.<p>

              <h4>Creativity</h4>

              <p>Code is a creative medium: this has been the biggest surprise of my recent studies. I had always thought
                that there was only one right way to write code, but it turns out there are many ways to approach building a website.
                There are rules and conventions, of course, in the same way every visual or verbal medium has, but code is a
                flexible medium. A few characters of code can mix a colour or style a title without even needing a graphic design
                program - though those are useful too.</p>

              <p>I am an award-winning artist with 17 exhibitions under my belt - and I am still finding new ways to be creative.
                I have signed up for Skillcrush’s Break Into Tech course package and added on their User Experience Blueprint course package. I expect this
                new path is going to keep me engaged for quite some time.</p>

              <p>I don’t know exactly where this is going to take me in life. Though that’s part of what makes it interesting.<p>


              <p><em><strong>‘I don’t know’</strong></em> - is where creativity is born. Perfection leaves no room for growth and shedding assumptions
                is the first step to shifting perspective and opening up to new opportunities.</p>

              <p>I may not have everything figured out about my new path, but I will tell you this:</p>

              <p><em><strong>I have never been afraid of a blank canvas.</strong></em></p>
